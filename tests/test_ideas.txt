Test: DCA buys shares correctly
Goal: Verify that DCA always invests the monthly amount, for every month, no conditions.
Test dataset:
Dates: 3 months
Prices: 100, 200, 400
Amount: 100
Expected:
Shares = 100/100 + 100/200 + 100/400
Cash = 0
Final value = shares * last_price

Test: Dip strategy buys only when dip threshold met
Dataset:
Prices: 100 → 95 → 120
Threshold: 5%
Amount: 100
Expected:
Buy in month 2 only (because 95 is a ≥5% dip from 100)
Buy nothing month 3
Cash accumulates correctly
Shares correct

Test: All prices increasing
Dip strategy never triggers.
Expected:
DCA fully invested
Dip has full cash leftover
DCA should be > Dip
