<h1>Buying the Dip Isn’t Always Wrong — Here’s When It Helps</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>
  Across most assets and long time horizons, buying the dip underperforms
  dollar-cost averaging. That result is now well established.
</p>

<p>
  What is easier to miss is that the strategy does not fail universally.
  In certain environments, buying the dip does exactly what intuition
  suggests it should.
</p>

<p>
  This article focuses on those exceptions—not to rehabilitate dip-buying
  as a default strategy, but to clarify <strong>when it helps, why it helps,
  and why that help is often temporary</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Understanding these conditions is essential, because they explain both
  the appeal of dip-buying and the trap it creates.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>
  If buying the dip usually underperforms, why does it sometimes work?
</p>

<p>
  Short-term results in certain assets appear to validate the strategy.
  In the data, there are clear cases where waiting for pullbacks improves
  outcomes over 10-year windows.
</p>

<p>
  The question is not whether these cases exist—they do—but what they have
  in common, and whether their success can be relied on.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What the Data Shows</h2>

<p>
  The clearest examples appear in assets with high volatility and weak
  long-term growth.
</p>

<p>
  Over 10-year windows, buying the dip outperforms dollar-cost averaging
  in Silver across every tested dip threshold. Similar, though less
  consistent, patterns appear in certain individual stocks during
  range-bound periods.
</p>

<p>
  These outcomes are not marginal. They are strong enough to feel like
  confirmation—and strong enough to encourage continued use of the strategy.
</p>

<p>
  The full set of results, including where this pattern holds and where it
  breaks down, is summarized in <code>arrays.html</code>, which serves as the
  shared evidence base for the series.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why It Works (Temporarily)</h2>

<p>
  Buying the dip performs best in environments with three characteristics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>High volatility</li>
  <li>Mean reversion rather than sustained growth</li>
  <li>Limited internal compounding</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In these conditions, prices fall often enough—and recover often enough—
  that waiting for pullbacks improves average entry prices without
  sacrificing too much exposure.
</p>

<p>
  The strategy benefits not from time, but from oscillation.
</p>

<p>
  This is why dip-buying can appear effective in commodities like Silver
  or in individual stocks that trade sideways for extended periods.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why This Creates a False Sense of Confidence</h2>

<p>
  Ten years is long enough to feel definitive.
</p>

<p>
  When a strategy outperforms over a decade, it is easy to conclude that
  it has uncovered a structural advantage. In reality, those results may
  simply reflect a favorable regime.
</p>

<p>
  The danger is not that buying the dip fails immediately—it is that it
  works just long enough to build conviction before the underlying
  conditions change.
</p>

<p>
  When volatility fades, trends emerge, or growth reasserts itself, the
  advantage disappears.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Why the Edge Does Not Survive Time</h2>

<p>
  Over longer horizons, the same assets that rewarded dip-buying begin to
  favor consistent exposure instead.
</p>

<p>
  In the 30-year results, even Silver no longer benefits from waiting.
  Dollar-cost averaging pulls ahead by remaining invested during the
  relatively small number of periods when gains actually occur.
</p>

<p>
  The conditions that support dip-buying—frequent reversals, bounded
  ranges, persistent volatility—are not stable over decades.
</p>

<p>
  Time, not timing, eventually dominates.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>What This Does Not Mean</h2>

<p>
  This article does not argue that buying the dip is always a mistake.
</p>

<p>
  It does not claim that volatility cannot be exploited, or that all timing
  strategies are doomed to fail.
</p>

<p>
  What it shows is more specific: <strong>buying the dip is a context-dependent
  tactic, not a universally reliable strategy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Applying it outside the environments where it works transforms a
  temporary advantage into a persistent drag.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Final Takeaway</h2>

<p>
  Buying the dip can help when prices oscillate and growth is weak.
</p>

<p>
  It struggles when assets compound and trends dominate.
</p>

<p>
  The problem is not that dip-buying never works—it is that it works
  selectively, temporarily, and often just long enough to encourage
  overconfidence.
</p>

<p>
  Understanding <em>when</em> it helps is the difference between using it
  deliberately and being misled by it.
